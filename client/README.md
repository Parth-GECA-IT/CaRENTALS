# CaRENTALS Client

This is the client-side application for the **CaRENTALS** project, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It provides a seamless user interface for car rental services.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

You can start customizing the application by editing the files in the `app/` directory. Changes will automatically reflect in the browser.
